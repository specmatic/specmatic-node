# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

## Project setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This also downloads the qontract.jar file of the version specified in src/config.ts.
3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/qontract/qontract-node.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.

## Committing and Pushing changes

Please make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes by using the command

`npm test`

Build the dist files using

`npm run build`

## After the PR is merged
This is currently a manual step. See [this link](https://github.com/qontract/qontract-node/issues/6) to understand why.
Check the current version of the npm module

`npm version`

Bump up the version of the npm module according to [semver](https://semver.org/) and run 

`npm version new.version.number`

### Update Typings

If your PR introduced some changes in the API, you are more than welcome to
modify the Typescript type definition to reflect those changes. Just modify the
`/types/index.d.ts` file accordingly. If you have never seen Typescript
definitions before, you can read more about it in its
[documentation pages](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).
Though this library itself is not written in Typescript we use
[dtslint](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint) to lint our typings.
